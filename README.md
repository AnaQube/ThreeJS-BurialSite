Lobotomy Corp themed ThreeJS environment with some Twitch functionality

Front-end code only

If the website doesn't work, it's probably because the backend servers are spinning up after shutting down (or Cloudflare is being weird)

Try lobotomy.anakyu.io as well since that may play nicer with the backend

Append "?channel=" and "?brightness=" to the URL to control the channel and brightness respectively.
